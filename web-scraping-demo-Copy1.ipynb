      "                  Most of the Countries collect information/ maintain inventory on the Chemical and Petrochemical sector for monitoring and policy making to improve this sector. There is standard practice for data collection for those countries who are the member of the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) and other countries. D/o Chemicals and Petrochemicals, M/o Chemicals and Fertilizers are desirous to make a Web Based Application/ Portal to develop an Integrated Data Management system (IDMS) for the Chemical and Petrochemicals Sector.  The main goal is to design an integrated data management that would gather, store and share information about various facets of the chemical and petrochemical industry including market standards as well as allow for mapping all relevant data to automate different fields of chemicals and petrochemical sector for the Govt. of India. With the designed system, the specific data variable needs like advanced product search and comparison, technical data sheets generation, and creating a solid data management platform for true collaboration of different countries information.\n",

      "                  Cases differ substantially in the time required for a fair and timely adjudication, not all cases make the same demands upon judicial system resources. Thus, they need not be subject to the same processing requirements. The concept of Case Flow Management for High Court and Subordinate Courts was first introduced through the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in the case of Salem Advocate Bar Association v. Union of India, following which the Model Draft Rules were proposed by the Law Commission, Jagannadha Rao Committee, wherein model case management rules endorsed by the Supreme Court also containing timelines for different case types, the upper limit of which is two years were proposed.   Problem Statement/Challenge: Computerization has failed to improve the case scheduling process. However, solving some administrative problems through the aid of technology could reduce the constraints under which judges work and ensure the timely listing of cases thus aiding the speedy disposal of cases. A 'Differentiated Case Flow Management(DCM) system would enable a court to prioritize cases and the recognition that many cases can and should proceed through the court system at a faster pace than others if appropriate pathways are provided.   Objective/Expected Outcome: Under a DCM system, cases do not wait for disposition simply on the basis of the chronological order of their filing. This would greatly aid in minimizing and making more predictable the time between case events more and aid efficient disposal of cases.\n",

What are my rights as a citizen? 2. How can I file a complaint? 3. How can I access legal aid services? 4. How can I obtain legal documents? 5. What are the legal implications of a particular action?  The digital assistant should also be able to provide information on various legal topics, such as  family law, property law, labor law, and criminal law.  Judging criteria: 1. Effectiveness in providing legal information and guidance in a user-friendly manner 2. Ease of accessibility through various devices and languages 3. Innovation in design and functionality 4. Potential for scalability and sustainability 5. Impact on improving legal awareness and access to justice for marginalized communities.    Note: The Digital solution should be integrated with an all-encompassing framework of Know-  Your-Rights, as described under Develop a comprehensive, accessible, and user-friendly Know-Your-Rights  framework that will educate citizens in India about their legal rights, entitlements, and remedies.  Background: Many citizens in India are unaware of their legal rights and often do not know how  to seek redressal in case of legal violations. A comprehensive Know-Your-Rights framework can  help citizens become better informed about their legal rights and help them navigate the legal  system to seek redressal.  Possible solution components:  1. Identification of relevant laws and regulations: Identify and compile all relevant laws and  regulations that govern various aspects of citizensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lives in India.  2. Simplification of legal language: Simplify the legal language of these laws and regulations  so that they are easily understandable by the common citizen.  3. Categorization of legal rights: Categorize these laws and regulations according to the legal  rights they protect. For example, laws relating to labour rights can be grouped under one  category, while those relating to consumer rights can be grouped under another. Indexing    all the Laws of the Central Government and State Governments in India with auto-  categorization of legal rights of respective types of beneficiaries such as tribals, senior    citizens, persons with disability, etc., under the Know-Your-Rights Framework for India.  4. User-friendly design: Design an easy-to-navigate website or mobile application that is  user-friendly and accessible to all. The platform should be designed keeping in mind the  diverse needs of the users, including those with disabilities.  5. Interactive features: Incorporate interactive features such as chatbots, virtual assistants,  and decision trees to make it easier for users to navigate the platform and find the  information they need.  6. Regional language support: Ensure that the platform is available in multiple regional  languages to reach a wider audience.  7. Collaboration with legal aid providers: Collaborate with legal aid providers to ensure that  the platform is regularly updated and reflects changes in the legal landscape.  Expected outcomes:  1. A user-friendly and comprehensive Know-Your-Rights framework that is accessible to  citizens across India.  2. Increased awareness among citizens about their legal rights and entitlements.  3. Improved access to justice for citizens through a better understanding of the legal system.  4. Increased collaboration between legal aid providers and citizens.  5. Development of innovative solutions for legal education and awareness.\n",

      "                  The objective of this hackathon is to develop a blockchain-based eVault system for  legal records that can ensure security, transparency, and accessibility for all stakeholders. The  system should be able to store, manage, and share legal records securely and efficiently, with the  potential to integrate with existing legal databases and case management systems.  Requirements:  1. The eVault system should be based on a blockchain platform such as Ethereum,  Hyperledger, or Corda, should use smart contracts to manage access, permissions,  and transactions.  2. The system should have user-friendly interfaces for lawyers, judges, clients, and other  stakeholders to interact with the eVault, with features such as uploading and retrieving  documents, tracking changes, and sharing information.  3. The system should ensure the privacy and confidentiality of legal records, with appropriate  access controls, encryption, and authentication mechanisms.  4. The system should allow for seamless integration with existing legal databases and case  management systems, to ensure interoperability and ease of use.  5. The system should be scalable and adaptable to accommodate future changes and  upgrades.  Expected Outcomes:  1. A functional prototype of the blockchain-based eVault system for legal records, with a  user-friendly interface and features such as document upload, retrieval, and sharing.  2. A detailed design document outlining the architecture, features, and technical  specifications of the eVault system.  3. A business plan outlining the potential impact, market opportunities, and revenue models  for the eVault system.  4. A presentation of the prototype, design document, and business plan.  Impact: The development of a blockchain-based eVault system for legal records can have a  significant impact on improving access to justice in India. It can lead to faster, more efficient  court proceedings, reduced costs, improved data integrity, and increased trust in the justice  system. Moreover, it can provide a secure and transparent platform for storing and sharing legal  records, making it easier for clients to access their own records and for lawyers to access relevant  case information.\n",

      "                  Legal documentation can be a complicated and time-consuming process, especially  for individuals and small businesses who may not have access to legal resources. In addition, the  language and jargon used in legal documents can be difficult for non-lawyers to understand,  which can lead to errors and misunderstandings.  Objective: The objective of this hackathon challenge is to develop an AI-powered solution that  can simplify legal documentation for individuals and small businesses in India, by automatically  drafting legal documents in plain language and using easy-to-understand terms.  Potential Features: 1. User-friendly interface for inputting relevant information such as parties involved, terms  of the agreement, and other necessary details.  2. AI-powered document generation that automatically drafts legal documents in plain  language and using easy-to-understand terms.  3. Ability to customize legal documents based on the specific needs of the user. 4. Integration with existing legal resources and databases to ensure accuracy and  completeness of the legal documents.  5. Option for users to seek legal advice from an expert in case of complex legal issues.  Impact: The proposed solution can greatly benefit individuals and small businesses in India, who  often face challenges with legal documentation due to limited access to legal resources. By  simplifying legal documentation, this solution can potentially save time, reduce errors, and  increase access to justice.  Data: Participants can use publicly available legal databases and resources to train the AI model  for document generation.  Deliverables: 1. A working prototype of the AI-powered legal documentation assistant, demonstrating its  functionality and ease of use.  2. A presentation outlining the features and potential impact of the solution, as well as its  technical architecture and data requirements.  3. Code and documentation for the solution, along with instructions for deployment and  maintenance.  Note: Participants are encouraged to consider the ethical implications of their solution and to  prioritize data privacy and security.\n",

      "                  In India, the legal service sector is largely unorganized, making it difficult for  people to access legal services. Many legal service providers, such as advocates, arbitrators,  mediators, notaries, and document writers, operate independently and do not have a centralized  platform to offer their services to clients. This leads to a lack of transparency, difficulty in  finding the right legal service provider, and high costs for clients.  Objective: The objective of this hackathon is to develop an incentivized design to onboard legal  service providers on an eMarketplace to extend legal services to citizens in India.  Solution: Participants are expected to design a platform that can onboard legal service providers  on an eMarketplace and incentivize them to offer their services to clients. The platform should  be user-friendly, secure, and transparent, and should address the following challenges: 1. How to incentivize legal service providers to offer their services on the platform? 2. How to ensure transparency and accountability in the services provided by legal service  providers?  3. How to ensure the quality of legal services provided by the service providers? 4. How to ensure that clients can easily find the right legal service provider for their specific  legal needs?  5. How to ensure that the platform is accessible to citizens from all socio-economic  backgrounds?  Participants can consider various models for incentivizing legal service providers, such as  offering them bonuses, rewards, or other forms of recognition for their services. They can also  consider gamification techniques to motivate providers to offer quality services and compete  with each other on the platform. Additionally, they can explore ways to integrate the platform  with other legal service providers and institutions, such as courts, legal aid clinics, and bar  associations.  Deliverables: The deliverables for this hackathon are a functional prototype of the e-marketplace  platform, including wireframes, user stories, and a brief video demonstration of the platform's  features and functionalities. The platform should be designed to address the needs of both legal  service providers and clients and should offer a seamless user experience.\n",

      "                  The water footprint measures the amount of water used to produce each of the goods and  services we use. The water footprint helps us understand for what purposes our limited  freshwater resources are being consumed and polluted. The impact of it depends on where the  water is taken from and when if it comes from a place where water is already scarce, the    consequences can be significant and require action. The increase in the amount of non-  available water due to pollution and scarce groundwater level has added more water    footprints, at the community as well as at the personal levels. An increased water  footprint directly affects the health and future of the citizens. Preventing severe drought in  water-stressed areas is only going to be possible if water is used with more care and efficiency,  this can be done if we have readily available data on water footprints. Hence by using digital  technologies like AI, Big Data, Blockchain, etc, and computer languages, a user-friendly app or  website may be developed which can provide the water footprints of different items/ final  products we use in daily life by feeding little inputs or just by scanning through the camera like  Google lens. The app should support local languages, this will ensure pan-India usage and  sensitize the people about the water footprints of items they use in daily life.\n",

      "                  Water supply issues are related to sources and usage of raw water; intermittent water supply  and the quality of tap water at the consumersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ end. One of the major challenges facing is the  high level of water loss in distribution networks. Non-Revenue Water (NRW) is defined as the  difference between the amount of water put into the distribution system and the amount of  water recovered from consumers. NRW is a good indicator of water utility performance; In  addition, available NRW data are often found problematic, suspicious, inaccurate, or provide  only partial information. Hence, there is a need to develop a system or technology to trace and  tackle non-revenue water and convert it into revenue water using digital methods. This will  save water as well as increase profitability and improves the return on investment w.r.t water  distribution networks.\n",

      "                  Many states in India are regularly affected by flooding especially in monsoon season. Central Water Commission (CWC) issues flood warnings in all flood-prone districts based on the regularly measured water gauge level. Flood warnings are issued by CWC to the state administration, whenever the gauge levels cross the danger mark. In all such cases, the severity of the problem is essentially indicated in terms of flood levels. However, the major concern of the state administration is regarding the difficulty faced in assessing the spatial extent of flooding for mapping rescue and relief works. Large volumes of imagery corresponding to varied flood inundations are expected to be available with NRSA and other freely assessable sources. The past imageries corresponding to a specific forecast site can be collected and each imagery be stamped with the observed water level of that particular date and time. An AI-ML-based GIS application can be developed to process the available imageries for projecting new imageries using suitable interpolation/extrapolation of 2D information corresponding to specific flood levels within a given range. The participants of SIH are expected to develop the above-mentioned application using open-source software and demonstrate its utility for any one of the CWC’s forecast sites (List will be shared) with readily available imageries. Participants can also seek to add value by incorporating tools for making critical infrastructure, filtering outliers, pointing out accuracy levels of projected inundation, etc.\n",

      "                  Chacha Chaudhary was declared the mascot of the Namami Gange Programme at the 37th Executive  Committee meeting of the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG). NMCG has tied up with Diamond  Toons to develop and distribute comics, e-comics, and animated videos. The objective of bringing about  behavioral change amongst children towards the Ganga and other rivers. To make this solution more  interactive one step further ahead, AI, ML &amp; Chat boat-powered Interactive Robot Mascot (Chacha  Chaudhary) would add value to the product for the river people connect component of Namami Gange.  Prerequisites:  It should be an independent robot to connect with the School children, the common man, and all    stakeholders of NMCG for creating awareness &amp; information dissemination. The product should be user-  friendly &amp; citizen-centric.    Solution: An interactive robot named “Chacha Chaudhary” would be the Artificial intelligence &amp;  machine learning &amp; chat boat-enabled mascot of the Namami Gange made with the help of a touch  panel, greets visitors at the entrance and takes them along to each component of the Namami Gange  flagship program in River Basin War Room &amp; Ganga Museum. The digital avatar of Chacha Chaudhary  would also enable on the NMCG website. Robot Mascot (Chacha Chaudhary) &amp; digital avatar solution  would be providing to actively engage with citizens to impart information, awareness, and education  around riverine ecology in an interactive format of digital and outdoor installations.

      "                  The use of social media data in disaster and crisis management is increasing rapidly. Particularly in  connection to flooding events, water quality issues in ponds/lakes, urban flooding, and drainage problem, etc., geo-referenced images shared by citizens can provide situational awareness to emergency  responders, as well as assist with financial loss assessment, giving information that would otherwise  be very hard to collect through conventional sensors or remote sensing products. Discussion about such  events can also be found on various social media platforms. Further, recent advances in computer vision  and deep learning can perhaps support the automated analysis of these data. In this problem, software/  algorithm to be developed focusing on ground-level images taken by humans. Considering distinct  datasets from different sources, the algorithm of the developed mobile app should be able to categorize  water-related problems at different administrative. Further, the mobile app should serve as a  valuable tool for the administrators for planning and managing water-related problems.\n",

Whether the area is suitable for water well construction or not?  ii. At what depth water-bearing zones are expected to be encountered;  iii. What is the expected discharge of the well;  iv. what is the most suitable drilling technique in the area;  v. What is the expected quality of groundwater in the area and other relevant information?

      "                  In modern agricultural practices, efficient water management plays a critical role in achieving optimal crop yields, conserving water resources, and maintaining ecological balance. However, existing irrigation systems often lack the precision required to deliver water tailored to the actual needs of crops, leading to water wastage, suboptimal plant growth, and environmental degradation. This problem is particularly pronounced in piped and micro irrigation networks, where traditional methods of manual control fail to adapt dynamically to varying soil moisture conditions within the root zone of crops.  The core issue lies in the absence of an automated mechanism that can regulate the release of water based on real-time soil moisture availability. The inconsistency in water distribution and the inability to synchronize irrigation with crop water requirements result in detrimental outcomes for both the agricultural yield and water conservation efforts.  To address this problem, there is a compelling need for an innovative solution that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to enable the automatic regulation of valves for water release in piped and micro irrigation networks. By incorporating AI-powered soil moisture monitoring and decision-making processes, this solution aims to bridge the gap between water supply and crop demand, while also optimizing resource utilization and minimizing environmental impact.  Key Challenges:  Dynamic Water Demand: Crops have varying water requirements influenced by factors such as growth stage, weather conditions, and plant type. Developing an AI system capable of accurately predicting these dynamic water demands is a complex challenge.  Real-time Data Integration: Integrating real-time soil moisture data from multiple sensors across a field into a centralized AI system requires robust data collection, transmission, and processing mechanisms.  Algorithm Precision: Designing AI algorithms that can effectively analyze soil moisture data, historical trends, and other relevant parameters to make accurate decisions about water release timing and quantities.  Valve Control Mechanism: Developing an automated valve control mechanism that can respond swiftly and accurately to the AI's recommendations while considering the physical characteristics of the piped and micro irrigation network.  Adaptability: Ensuring that the AI system can adapt to changing environmental conditions, crop types, and variations in soil properties over time.  User-Friendly Interface: Designing a user-friendly interface that allows farmers and irrigation managers to monitor and intervene in the system as needed, while also trusting in the AI's autonomous decisions.  Economic Viability: Balancing the potential costs of implementing an AI-driven system with the expected benefits in terms of increased crop yield, water savings, and operational efficiency.\n",

      "                  Effective management of water resources in reservoirs is a crucial aspect of mitigating flooding, ensuring water availability, and maintaining ecological balance in a basin. The challenge lies in accurately estimating the inflow to a reservoir, taking into account various factors such as rainfall, soil moisture conditions within the reservoir's catchment area, and upstream reservoir releases. The subsequent task of managing reservoir gates to release water in a controlled manner to prevent flooding adds another layer of complexity.   The existing methodologies for reservoir management often rely on manual intervention or simplistic models that may not capture the intricacies of changing environmental conditions. As a result, basins are vulnerable to both overflows and insufficient water supply during critical periods. To address this issue, there is a pressing need for an innovative solution that integrates data-driven approaches and automation to optimize reservoir gate operations and mitigate flood risks.     Key Challenges:   Accurate Inflow Estimation: Developing a robust and accurate method to estimate the inflow to a reservoir by considering multiple parameters, including rainfall intensity, soil moisture conditions within the catchment area, and potential contributions from upstream reservoir releases.   Real-time Data Integration: Integrating real-time data from weather forecasts, soil moisture sensors, and upstream reservoir releases into a centralized system for inflow estimation and decision-making.   Model Complexity: Designing sophisticated models that can effectively capture the complex interactions between rainfall, soil moisture, reservoir levels, and inflow dynamics, while remaining computationally feasible.   Optimal Gate Control: Developing an automated gate control mechanism that can regulate the release of water from the reservoir in a manner that prevents flooding downstream while ensuring optimal utilization of the stored water.   Flood Risk Assessment: Incorporating flood risk assessment models that consider downstream vulnerability, historical flood patterns, and potential impacts of various release strategies.   Adaptive Decision-Making: Creating algorithms that can adapt to changing conditions, such as sudden heavy rainfall events or unexpected reservoir releases from upstream, to make timely and accurate decisions.   Communication and Coordination: Ensuring effective communication and coordination among various stakeholders, including reservoir managers, weather forecast providers, and upstream reservoir operators.   Balancing Water Needs: Striking a balance between releasing enough water to prevent flooding while also maintaining a sufficient reservoir volume for future water supply and downstream water needs.   The proposed solution seeks to tackle these challenges by employing advanced data analytics, machine learning, and automation technologies. By creating an integrated system that leverages real-time data and predictive models, the solution aims to optimize reservoir gate operations to prevent flooding while optimizing water utilization. This would lead to enhanced flood resilience, improved water management, and increased ecological sustainability within the basin.\n",

      "                  Energy consumption in industrial and commercial facilities is a major expense for businesses and contributes significantly to environmental pollution.  The lack of visibility and control over energy usage makes it difficult for businesses to manage their energy costs and reduce their carbon footprint. conventional energy management systems have limitations in terms of accuracy and scalability and often require manual intervention to operate effectively. To address these challenges, an Al-powered energy management system can be developed that uses machine learning algorithms and data analytics to optimize energy consumption in industrial and commercial facilities. The system will collect real-time energy data from various sources, such as sensors and meters, and use this data to predict energy usage patterns and identify opportunities for energy savings. The system will also provide recommendations for energy-efficient practices and automate the control of energy-consuming devices, such as lighting and HVAC systems, to optimize energy consumption.  The Al-powered energy management system will be designed to be scalable and adaptable to different types of industrial and commercial facilities. it will also be user-friendly, providing an intuitive interface for facility managers and building owners to monitor and control energy usage. The system will be designed to integrate with existing building automation systems and will be able to operate autonomously with minimal human intervention,  The goal of developing an Al-powered energy management system is to help businesses  reduce their energy costs, improve their operational efficiency, and reduce their  environmental impact by optimizing their energy consumption.

Webpage/service accessed/information consumed by the users.  4. Job suggestions based on a potential match in job requirements and  skillsets of registered users  5. Collective analysis of success/ failure rate of the user profile with  respect to job requirements for better future suggestions along with job recommendations using algorithms like Genetic Algorithm or Collaborative Filtering or any other recommendation algorithm    The details are expected to be displayed using better visualization tools  to enable the teams to analyze how and why people engage, convert,  and retain—in real-time, across devices—to improve their user  experience.

      "                  Currently, used prosthetic systems for lower limb amputees can replicate normal human locomotion to a maximum extent which is considered a basic need; however, finding the ideal prosthetic solution for their desired lifestyle can be difficult. From the survey, it has been observed that there is a demand from the lower limb amputee population regarding the use of motorbikes for transport purposes. However, for lower limb amputees, this operation creates some inconvenience as there is no active ankle movement. Most importantly, the prosthetic feet currently used in the Indian context possess stationery ankles, and in some cases, more advanced feet use hydraulics or external-powered systems which don't solve the practical requirements of riding motorbikes for this patient population. The main functions when riding a motorcycle is gear selection and brake operation using the amputated leg. The right foot applies the rear brake on the right side of the motorbike. This is normally operated with ankle movements to press down the foot on the brake lever. Considering the inconveniences being caused to the lower limb amputees, there is a requirement for some modification options such as utilizing a modified brake lever. Alternatively, the left side of the bike has a gear selector to accentuate the controlled speed. This is usually activated by left ankle movements to move the forefoot up and down depending on whether the gears need to go up or down. The modification for the lower limb amputees may include the left-hand thumb operated up and down gear selection to module the operation of active ankle prosthesis in either direction for forefoot up and down motions at 5-10 degrees intervals to engage and disengage the gear module. Development of brake operation will be useful to resolve the practical issues of riding motorbikes in lower limb amputees, the dream of which was once upon a time lost due to the lower limb amputation\n",

      "                  Cognitive retraining is a therapeutic strategy that seeks to improve or restore a person's skills in the areas of paying attention, remembering, organizing, reasoning and understanding, problem-solving, decision-making, and higher-level cognitive abilities. Children with Developmental Disability have various cognitive Disabilities.  It is common for children with developmental disabilities to suffer from various cognitive disabilities. Presently many therapists use manual cognitive retraining and it is also difficult to monitor home-based training. Few centers offer EEG Neuro-Feedback Training.  The present proposal is the combined form of Both EEG Neuro-feedback and home training. Clinicians can easily monitor the changes based on the progress in- home training as well as changes in EEG profile with a single software.\n",

      "This software should be able to find out the area or more precisely the threat zone in which the radiations and blast waves of an explosion will spread to damage its surrounding locality.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been observed in many explosions and fires in industries, say according to the official report of Jaipur IOCL Fire' by 'SK ROY, GM (ISE), CO INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LIMITED, held on 29 October 2009, where the fire following an explosion in a tank caused 9 tanks out of 11 to explode drastically after the first explosion and the fire continues to spread it's havoc for a sum total of 11 days and no fire personnel, experts and fire services could suggest ways to put off the fire and the fire extinguished by itself after the crude oil(fuel in the tanks on fire) gets totally burned.\n",
      "According to this report, later MB LAL Committee provided 118 recommendations for oil installations but the fighting capabilities cannot be utilized if they can not be directed through the right way and direction of approach towards the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above example shows that even if we have sufficient firefighting resources but if they approach the fire from the wrong direction say from a direction or zone where radiation is at its peak or from where the efficiency of firefighting will be least the available resources are of no use.\n",
      "\n",
      "One should know the zone affected by the fire and the area where the radiations will be very high, high, medium, or low i.e. areas could be distinguished according to the radiations and potential to damage the human, flora, and fauna of the locality present in that threat zone. If a fire will be tackled from the right direction it can be extinguished in a more efficient manner with the least use of resources, and the least wastage of resources, within the least time.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most useful advantages of such software is that it can be used to evacuate people and animals from areas with disastrous exposure to radiation so that more and more lives can be saved until the fire will be extinguished or under control. So, such software should be made and propagated among fire personnel for its more efficient and convenient use for different eases and zones for different types of storage i.e different threat zones for different types of storage like LPG bullets, Horton spheres storing the same volume of LPG with different wind speed and wind directions will have different affected areas under radiations.\n",
      "\n",

      "                  Challenge Description:\n",
      "In large-scale mining, shovel operators are responsible for loading materials onto dumpers. However, the lack of real-time visibility regarding the load status of dumpers often leads to inefficiencies and delays in the overall workflow. Currently, shovel operators rely on manual communication or visual cues to determine whether a dumper is ready for loading or its loading has been completed. \n",
      "The challenge is to create a system that provides shovel operators with instant and accurate information about the load status of dumpers, eliminating the need for manual communication and improving the efficiency of the operation. The solution should leverage real-time data from sensors or other reliable sources to deliver timely updates to shovel operators, enabling them to make informed decisions and optimize their loading process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solution should address the following key aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "Real-time Monitoring: Develop a mechanism to continuously monitor the load status of dumpers in real time. This may involve integrating sensors, IoT devices, or any other suitable technology to collect and transmit data reliably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visualization and Alerts: Design an intuitive interface that displays the load status of each dumper to the shovel operator in real time. The interface should provide clear visual indicators and notifications to inform the operator about the readiness of each dumper for loading as well as inform the shove operator when the loading of the dumper is completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data Integration: Create a system that seamlessly integrates with existing infrastructure, such as the shovel operator's workstation or control panel. The solution should ensure smooth data transmission and compatibility with other systems or software used in the mining site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scalability and Robustness: Develop a solution that can handle a large number of dumpers simultaneously and is capable of operating reliably in challenging environments. Consider factors such as connectivity issues, data synchronization, and potential disruptions in the mining site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security and Privacy: Implement appropriate security measures to protect the system from unauthorized access and ensure the privacy of sensitive data. Consider encryption, authentication, and other relevant security practices to safeguard the system and maintain data integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these aspects, the proposed solution should enhance the productivity and efficiency of shovel operators, reduce downtime caused by miscommunication or delays, and ultimately optimize the loading process in mining operations.\n",

      "                  When forest land needs to be diverted for developmental projects, it is crucial to have an accurate understanding of the tree population within the affected area. Traditional methods of tree enumeration, such as manual surveys or ground-based assessments, can be time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. To address these challenges, the challenge is to develop an image analytics solution that automates the tree enumeration process using satellite imagery or aerial photographs, or any other means (using section view)..\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed solution should address the following key aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "Image Data Analysis: Develop a computer vision algorithm that can analyze satellite imagery or aerial photographs to detect and identify trees within the designated forest areas accurately. The algorithm should account for variations in tree species, sizes, and environmental conditions to ensure reliable results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tree Counting and Categorization: Design a system that can count the number of trees in the specified area and categorize them based on their species or other relevant parameters like diameter(girth). The solution should provide accurate and detailed information about the tree population to facilitate decision-making during the land diversion process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accuracy and Validation: Create mechanisms to validate the accuracy of the image analytics solution by comparing the results with ground-truth data obtained through manual surveys or other reliable methods. The solution should aim to achieve a high level of accuracy and minimize false positives or false negatives in tree identification and counting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scalability and Efficiency: Develop an efficient and scalable solution capable of processing large volumes of image data within a reasonable timeframe. Consider optimization techniques and parallel processing approaches to ensure timely results, especially for large forest areas or time-sensitive projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integration and Visualization: Enable seamless integration of the image analytics solution with existing forest management systems or tools. Provide visualizations or interactive interfaces that allow users to explore and interpret the results easily. This could include the generation of maps, reports, or other visual representations of the tree enumeration data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ethical and Environmental Considerations: Ensure the solution adheres to ethical practices, respects privacy concerns, and minimizes potential environmental impact. Consider the privacy of sensitive data, secure storage of images, and compliance with environmental regulations throughout the development and deployment of the solution.\n",
      "\n",

      "                  Coal transportation involves a complex network of multiple modes of transportation, including trucks, trains, and ships. However, the lack of a unified digital platform for tracking and monitoring coal movement across these modes often leads to inefficiencies, delays, and a lack of transparency in the coal supply chain. This hampers the ability of stakeholders, such as coal producers, transporters, and end-users, to make informed decisions and optimize logistics operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The challenge is to develop a digital platform that provides multi-modal visibility of coal transportation, allowing stakeholders to track the movement of coal from source to destination seamlessly. The platform should leverage image analytics, data integration, and advanced visualization techniques to provide real-time insights into the location, status, and condition of coal shipments. It should enable effective coordination, proactive decision-making, and optimization of logistics operations for all stakeholders involved in the coal supply chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solution should address the following key aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "Data Integration: Create a scalable and robust system that integrates data from various sources, such as GPS devices, sensors, transportation management systems, and third-party APIs. The platform should be capable of handling large volumes of data from different modes of transportation and ensure the accuracy and reliability of the integrated information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multi-Modal Tracking: Develop image analytics capabilities to analyze real-time images or video feeds from cameras installed at critical points in the coal transportation network. The platform should identify and track coal-carrying vehicles, wagons, or ships, and provide accurate information on their location, movement, and capacity utilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real-Time Visualization: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that displays real-time data on the location and status of coal shipments across multiple modes of transportation. The platform should provide interactive maps, dashboards, and alerts that enable stakeholders to monitor and analyze the coal transportation process effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analytics and Optimization: Incorporate advanced analytics techniques to generate insights and actionable recommendations for optimizing coal logistics operations. The platform should identify bottlenecks, predict delays, and suggest alternative routes or transportation modes to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and minimize environmental impact.\n",
      "\n",

      "                  Operating a dragline, a large excavation machine used in mining and construction requires precision, skill, and a deep understanding of the operating environment. However, there is a need for a smart guidance and support system that assists dragline operators by providing real-time information, alerts, and guidance, ultimately enhancing their performance and ensuring safe and accurate operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The challenge is to develop an in-cab smart guidance and support system that empowers dragline operators with the following capabilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "Real-time Environmental Awareness: Develop a system that utilizes computer vision or sensor-based technologies to provide dragline operators with real-time information about their surroundings. This includes detecting and alerting the operator about potential hazards, obstacles, or unsafe conditions, such as proximity to other equipment, uneven terrain, or approaching vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operational Guidance and Monitoring: Create an interface that offers intuitive guidance and instructions to the dragline operator based on real-time data analysis. The system should provide visual cues, overlays, or augmented reality displays that assist the operator in achieving precise digging, loading, and dumping operations, optimizing productivity, and minimizing material loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance Monitoring and Analysis: Implement mechanisms to track and analyze the performance of dragline operators in real time. The system should capture relevant operational data, such as cycle times, digging depth, fuel consumption, and maintenance requirements, to provide feedback and performance metrics that can be used for continuous improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operator Training and Skill Development: Design interactive modules or simulations within the system that facilitate operator training and skill development. The system should provide virtual scenarios, real-time feedback, and performance benchmarks to help operators enhance their skills, decision-making abilities, and overall efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integration and Scalability: Develop a solution that can seamlessly integrate with existing Dragline systems and infrastructure. The system should be compatible with the dragline's control systems, sensors, and data sources, ensuring reliable data transmission and compatibility across different dragline models or manufacturers.\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these aspects, the proposed in-cab smart guidance and support system will enhance the situational awareness, operational efficiency, and safety of dragline operators. It will empower operators to make informed decisions, optimize their operations, and contribute to the overall productivity and success of mining or construction projects.\n",

      "                  Even in the most modern times, we are facing the problem, especially ladies, which is not having a hygienic toilet while traveling or going out. Here the problem statements aim to the development of an automatic self-cleaning, toilet system. Instead of water washing and all, the focus here is on ultraviolet disinfection, hot air drying, and smart saving of water. The final result is a toilet like that of a home. Also, there should be a provision to know the availability of the nearest toilets in working condition. In addition to the above, the smart toilet could also include the following features:\n",
      "\n",
      "A built-in air freshener: This would help to keep the toilet smelling fresh and clean.\n",
      "A motion sensor: This would automatically flush the toilet and open the lid when someone approaches.\n",
      "A built-in bidet: This would provide a more hygienic way to clean oneself after using the toilet.\n",

      "                  Considering the importance of air and water to human existence, air pollution and water pollution are critical issues that require collective effort for prevention and control. Different types of anthropogenic activities have resulted in environmental dilapidation and ruin. One of the tools that can be used for such a campaign is Air Quality Index (AQI). The AQI was based on the concentrations of different pollutants: We are also familiar with the Water Quality Index (WQI), which in simple terms tells what the quality of drinking water is from a drinking water supply. There is a need for constant and continuous environment monitoring of air quality and water quality for the development of AQI and WQI, which in turn will enable clear communication of how clean or unhealthy the air and water in the study area is.\n",

The exact location and number of the ladle has to be tracked in real-time and feedback is to be given to the local server for display. The hot metal Ladle travels from the TLC pit area to the converter for charging liquid hot metal and back. Steel Ladle travels from the Ladle preparation bay with liquid steel to secondary metallurgy units i.e. LF-1, LF-2, RH, or Twin LF, and then to one of the Caster machines for casting into billets and back.

It is evident that there are several books made available in ASU (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha) medical systems and every book claims that the book has been written as per CCIM or NCISM syllabus. Amongst some are good and some are of poor quality and were written with vested interest. Due to this, students are trapped by substandard books that leads to poor quality standard among students. Identifying this issue and its impact on medical on the medical system, NCISM constituted an expert committee for the development of an assessment scale for textbooks/ reference books. The expert committee after thorough deliberations developed the assessment scale for the quality assessment of textbooks/ reference books.\n",

      "                  ndia, with a rich heritage of floral diversity, is well-known for its medicinal plant wealth, but their identification is one of the major burning issues in Ayurvedic Pharmaceutics. Several crude drugs are being sold under the same name in the market leading to confusion and their misidentification. Even the collectors and traders are not completely aware of the exact morphological appearance or differentiating attributes of the many drugs owing to seasonal and geographical availability, and similar characteristics. Moreover, the extensive consumption to meet demand-supply ratio exerts a heavy strain on the existing resources. It further leads to the practice of adulteration, substitution, and disbelief in the curative capability of the system eventually. Thus, software capable of identifying different medicinal plants/ raw materials through Image Processing Using Different Machine Learning Algorithms will be of immense use. It will be helpful at every level viz. wholesaler, distributor, etc. of the supply chain of raw material being utilized in the system.\n",

      "                  The Global Burden of Disease project has shown that skin diseases continue to be the 4th leading cause of nonfatal disease burden worldwide. These conditions are often the presenting face of more severe systemic illnesses, including HIV and neglected tropical diseases (NTD). such as elephantiasis and other lymphedema-causing diseases. Additionally, skin disorders pose a significant threat to patients' well-being, mental health, ability to function, and social participation. However, it is very difficult to provide better dermatological care to under-served or resource-poor regions in a cost-effective manner owing to unavailability of efficient diagnostic tools, lack of connectivity, and poor laboratory infrastructure etc. Moreover, there is also a scarcity of physicians with dermatological training. Even, preliminary screening of a dermatological manifestation seems to be an arduous task. Thus, developing an Artificial intelligence-based tool (through Image processing technique) for preliminary diagnosis of numerous dermatological conditions will prove to be a boon in the health care system.\n",

      "constitution. It classifies all individuals into different 'Prakruti' types based on the theory of tridosha and each type has a varying degree of predisposition to different diseases. This is independent of racial, ethnic, or geographical considerations. Knowing which particular Prakruti one belongs to, enables them to decide the preference of food which suits them best. By following the rules and regulations regarding food and lifestyle, one can prevent themselves from getting inflicted with various diseases. But, Prakruti assessment is a tedious process that requires the individual to visit the physician followed by a long list of questions in order to reach a conclusion. In order to make this process more convenient, the development of a self- assessment tool with the help of artificial intelligence may prove to be a stepping stone. A Chatbot which has pre-recorded questionnaire may help in the Prakruti assessment depending upon the responses given by an individual.\n",

      "                  Ayurveda has a large database of single herbs, minerals, and formulations that have been tailormade to suit each individual, his/her psychosomatic constitution, clinical condition, comorbidities, age, region, etc. These data are spread over more than 150 texts, amidst manuscripts in multiple languages and scripts. With the rise of transcriptional and translational facilities, several traditional medicinal texts are now available in their digitized forms. But for an Ayurvedic student or practitioner, exploring this multitude of literature for identifying their \"\"drug of choice' often becomes tedious and impractical. Here is the need of a custom software that can identify the apt formulation that has been designed to treat a constellation of symptoms and present it to the student/practitioner along with its reference and other desired properties. For example, the two formulations Punarnavadi Kashaya and Vyaghryadi Kashaya are mentioned in texts as follows:  Both these are decoctions advised in Jvara (fever) and Kasa (cough). But in a patient with upper respiratory tract infections like common cold (Pinasa), Vyaghryadi would suit better than Punarnavadi. Whereas in a condition associated with inflammatory changes all over the body. I Punarnavadi would be the appropriate choice. The objective of the proposed software is to identify the single drugs and formulations that suit a set of symptoms. Certain ingredients (eg. jaggery) are unsuitable for certain categories of patients (e.g. diabetics). There are also medicine mediums that are unsuitable for specific diseases (e.g. fermented/alcoholic preparations in diabetes). Such information is also expected to be conveyed to the learner or practitioner who uses the software.  The same disease has been mentioned in different names (E.g. Jvara and Santapa for fever) and the same word has been used to denote different (Eg. Abhaya generally means Terminalia chebula but in the context of Jatyadi ghrita, it means Vetiveria zizanioides. The multiple names of same diseases are expected to be included in the tags of each formulation. The sources for the formulations, and synonyms and similar words have been included in the data section. It is also desirable to include the Ayurvedic pharmacological properties of the single drugs, and the compound formulation (called Rasa, Guna, Virya, Vipaka, etc.) as and where available.\n",

      "                  Today, each sector, such as education, health, agriculture, etc., is growing at a fast pace, and so is the infrastructure required for each sector. Developing infrastructure for each sector is a huge task and involves huge costs. Currently, a few tools are being used to monitor the day-to-day progress of the infrastructure, but they are all manual. This results in additional costs and the untimely completion of the infrastructural projects; thus, it affects the overall development of any sector. For further clarification, consider the infrastructure development associated with the education sector. If any government wants to set up a technical institute, it has to go through multiple processes, and one of the major processes is the timely establishment of the institute. With geo-tagging, it is possible to identify the chunk of land within the given location, district, town, etc., but the major challenge lies when it comes to the development of infrastructure. Currently, there is no mechanism available to monitor the progress on a real-time basis, so lots of manual intervention happens to monitor the progress. To overcome this issue, it is necessary to develop GIS and Al-based solutions through which real-time monitoring of the infrastructure can be done. Further, an application can also be developed that can work in both online and offline mode and through which day-to-day progress can be fed into the system. Thus, collected data can be populated into the system, and real-time monitoring using interactive dashboards and charts is possible. Further, the system will also provide flexibility to the user through simulation interference, which will help the user analyze the impact of an external factor on the time required for completion of the project.\n",

      "                  Campuses of colleges and universities are meant to be vibrant, free-flowing, and dynamic in nature. An accommodating campus supports idea exchange, personal growth, and soft skill development. The safety of students, especially women's students, is a pillar of an accommodating campus. In the present scenario, the measures available to college administrators and students, such as the installation of CCTV cameras, increased security on campuses, and the establishment of police outposts, are reactive in nature, i.e., they are pressed into action only after the occurrence of a mishap. The objective of the problem statement is to develop predictive analytic models to prevent mishaps even before they occur. The second issue pertaining to women's safety is the lack of manpower for proactive interventions to prevent mishaps. Another objective is to develop, monitor, predict, and provide actionable intelligence for the prevention of mishaps. The solution can explore the contours of anonymous and non-anonymous data collection mechanisms, point-to-point reporting systems, and predictive data analytics for providing actionable intelligence. Further, the collected data can be leveraged to develop and mark probable black spots and red time zones for pin-pointed actions to be taken by administrators.\n",
      "To promote a community-based system, the system may be designed in such a way that it not only gathers information from students but also involves the entire student community in the prevention of mishaps.\n",
      "The data collected from the participants can be populated into the system, and real-time monitoring can be done with an interactive dashboard and charts. It can also be used to develop real-time rapid intervention by the student community, college administration, and local authorities.\n",
      "Further to this, a companion model can also be developed for students that helps them travel through black spots and during red time zones. This will not only ensure the community participation of students but also develop a responsibility-sharing framework for campus safety.\n",

      "                  It is well established that development towards a more sustainable society must begin with education. When education is done right, it not only teaches people about the science of climate change and inequality and the reasons we must take action, it also engages, empowers and promotes a more environmentally friendly, community-based way of life. ESG in higher education is one of least discussed aspects of governance among administrators. With the recent energy and climate crisis, administrators around the globe have realized the importance of sustainable process. The three pillars of ESG are people, processes, and product.\n",
      "In our case, people are the most important stakeholder in achieving our goal. Students from campuses of Higher Education are not only woke about the climate-energy crises but also are passionate for deigning a world of their future. Administrators on other hand are aware of the rising cost of energy and are open to adopting energy conservation and other aspects of ESG\n",
      "The objective of the problem statement solution shall be to create a common platform for planning, development, execution, and monitoring of ESG initiative. The initiatives may include adopting alternative sources of energy, development of energy efficient campuses, adopting green construction standards like GRIHA Prakriti and similar such initiatives. Another objective of the problem statement solution is to generate and produce dynamic dashboards which show targeted lacking areas as well as progress check for currently undertaken projects. The overall objective of the solution should be based on a collaborative effort between all the stakeholder for creating ESG framework in Higher Education. If executed effectively the solution will not only make a significance difference to the present scenario but also create a generation of environmentally and socially aware citizens with in depth knowledge on ESG issues.\n",
      "The solution should be in line with India's ambition of achieving its targets under COP 21 of Paris Agreement. It should also incorporate the best practice steps taken by governments like the International Solar Alliance. The overall objective of the solution shall be to develop a common monitoring dashboard for all ESG Initiatives taken by the state and predictive solution based on best practices across the globe.\n",

      "                  Cyber intrusion attempts and cyber-attacks in any critical sector are carried out with a malicious intent. ln Power sector, it's either to compromise the power Supply system or to render the grid operation in-secure. Any such compromise may result in maloperation of equipmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, equipment damages or even in a cascading grid brownout/blackout. The much-hyped air gap myth between lr and or systems now stands shattered. The artificial air gap created by deploying firewalls between any lr and or system can be jumped by an insider or an outsider through social engineering.\n",
      "Cyber-attacks are staged through tactics and techniques of lnitial Access, Execution, persistence, privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Command and Control, Exfiltration. After gaining an entry inside the system through privilege escalation, the control of lr network and operations of or systems can be taken over even remotely by any cyber adversary. The gain of sensitive operational data through such intrusions may help the Nation/State sponsored or non-sponsored adversaries and cyber-attackers to design more sinister and advanced cyber-attacks. \n",

One of the effective treatment consists of using an electronic device to suppress the tinnitus noise. Which finding the frequency of the tinnitus. noise and suppressing requires a lot of instrumental support. Thus if t can be possible that by observing and analysing the tinnitus noise by the electronic device in the ear, the device itself finds the tinnitus noise frequency and suppress it accordingly, bringing benefit to the patient suffering from tinnitus.\n",

      "                  In India the cost of a new Myoelectric/Bionic prosthetic arm can range from 1lakh - 2 lakh Rupees, putting the Myoelectric hand out of reach of many middle-class and lower middle-class patients/amputee, we decided to design and build a far cheaper and pocket friendly version of prosthetic arm with Myoelectric capabilities. We are using 3-DPrinting technology for the structure of the prosthetic hand, and servo motors and Arduino for the mechanical purpose, Myoware muscle sensor is responsible for reading the electrical signals generated by muscle. These components and microprocessor can bring the cost of the prosthetic arm much cheaper and pocket friendly for the patient/amputee.\n",

      " opened in Post Offices and 878 more shall be opened in the next two years. Although DNKs are being used by 800+ exporters, DoP is still not able to bring small traders, artisans and MSMEs onto the DNK platform as most of such entrepreneurs do not have the wherewithal to create web portals for displaying their products and accepting International e-Commerce orders, or they are find the regulatory and e-Commerce platform compliances too expensive or tedious. Moreover, the international customers find it difficult to trust the webportals or small entities. The private e-Commerce portals charge upto 40% of the sale price of orders, which is prohibitively expensive.\n",
      "Dak Ghar Niryat Kendra\" refers to a concept in the Indian postal system. It translates to \"\"Post Office Export Centre\"\" in English. The Dak Ghar Niryat Kendra is a specialized facility within a post office that offers services related to export of goods.The establishment of Dak Ghar Niryat Kendra aims to simplify and streamline the export process for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by leveraging the extensive postal network and infrastructure already in place. It provides exporters with a cost-effective and accessible solution for their export logistics requirements.\"\n",

      "volume of medical invoices, prescriptions, and lab test reports received from numerous providers, including doctors, hospitals, and labs, as well as from customers. To streamline our processes and improve efficiency, we aim to develop a system capable of extracting and standardizing these documents at a provider level. Additionally, we need to identify claims across different providers that exhibit similar document templates.\n",

      "To tackle this problem, we require the development of a robust Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm. This algorithm will automate the process of template extraction and standardization, allowing us to identify similarities and patterns across various documents. By comparing the templates used in different claims, we can effectively identify instances of potential fraud, even when the textual content has been altered.\n",

      "4. Scalability and Efficiency: Ensure the algorithm can handle a large volume of documents efficiently, considering the growing number of providers and customers we deal with. \n",

The primary criterion is the accuracy of detection, which measures the algorithm's ability to identify similarities in document templates accurately and efficiently. The algorithm should be able to detect instances where fraudulent customers exploit identical templates with minor modifications, distinguishing between suspicious and fraudulent documents. \n",
      "\n",
      "To aid in the interpretation and communication of the algorithm's findings, the detected output should be represented using color-coded flags. Amber flags can be used to indicate suspicious documents that exhibit similarities in template structure or design elements, while red flags should be assigned to identify documents with high potential for fraud. This visual representation will assist investigators in prioritizing their efforts and taking appropriate actions. \n",

The dataset should encompass different document types, such as medical invoices, prescriptions, and lab test reports, reflecting the real-world scenarios the algorithm will encounter during deployment. \n",
      "\n",
      "By using this self-generated dataset, the algorithm can be trained and evaluated under realistic conditions. This approach enables the algorithm to learn patterns and similarities that exist in actual documents, allowing it to accurately detect fraudulent claims and identify suspicious patterns across different providers and customers. \n",

      "                  A server log system, also known as a log management system, is a software tool that records and stores\n",
      "log messages generated by various components and applications running on a server. It provides a\n",
      "centralized location for collecting, analyzing, and managing logs to monitor and troubleshoot system\n",
      "issues and performance problems.\n",
      "Here are some basic Requirement of a server log system:\n",
      "1. Log Collection: The system collects log data from various sources, including operating systems,\n",
      "applications, services, and network devices. It can gather logs from different servers and\n",
      "consolidate them into a central repository.\n",
      "2. Log Storage: Log entries are typically stored in a structured format, such as plain text files or a\n",
      "database. The system may also employ compression and archival mechanisms to optimize storage\n",
      "space and retain logs for an extended period.\n",
      "3. Log Analysis and Search: The log system enables searching, filtering, and querying log data based\n",
      "on specific criteria, such as time range, log level, source, or custom keywords. This functionality\n",
      "helps in identifying patterns, anomalies, or events of interest.\n",
      "4. Alerting and Notifications: The system can be configured to send notifications or alerts based on\n",
      "predefined rules or thresholds. For example, it can notify administrators when critical errors occur\n",
      "or security-related events are detected in the logs.\n",
      "5. Log Visualization and Reporting: The log systems provide visual representations of log data, such\n",
      "as charts, graphs, and dashboards. Visualizations will help in gaining insights, identifying trends,\n",
      "and generating reports for auditing, compliance, or performance analysis.\n",
      "6. Log Retention and Compliance: Server logs retained for a certain period to comply with regulatory\n",
      "requirements or internal policies. The log system should support flexible retention periods and\n",
      "secure storage to meet these obligations.\n",
      "7. Integration and APIs: A robust log system offers APIs and integrations with other tools and\n",
      "systems. This allows developers and administrators to automate log analysis, integrate with\n",
      "security information and event management (SIEM) systems, or build custom solutions on top of\n",
      "the log data.\n",
      "So the developed software should provide the following features to the end-user;\n",
      "8. Server Provisioning: The system facilitates the deployment and provisioning of servers, including\n",
      "hardware configuration, operating system installation, and initial software setup. It may include\n",
      "tools for automated server deployment and configuration management.\n",
      "9. Monitoring and Performance Management: Server management systems monitor the health,\n",
      "performance, and resource utilization of servers. They collect and analyze data on CPU usage,\n",
      "memory usage, disk space, network traffic, and other metrics. Alerts and notifications are\n",
      "generated when predefined thresholds are exceeded.\n",
      "10. Patch Management and Updates: The system ensures that servers are kept up to date with\n",
      "security patches, bug fixes, and software updates. It automates the process of identifying,\n",
      "downloading, testing, and applying updates to minimize vulnerabilities and improve server\n",
      "stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Configuration Management: Server management systems help administrators maintain\n",
      "consistent configurations across servers. They provide tools for managing and enforcing server\n",
      "configurations, including software installations, network settings, user accounts, and security\n",
      "policies.\n",
      "12. Backup and Disaster Recovery: The system facilitates regular backups of server data and\n",
      "configurations to protect against data loss and facilitate disaster recovery. It may include features\n",
      "for scheduling backups, managing backup storage, and performing recovery operations in case of\n",
      "system failures.\n",
      "13. Logging and Auditing: The system captures and stores logs generated by servers for\n",
      "troubleshooting, compliance, and auditing purposes. It provides tools for analyzing logs, searching\n",
      "for specific events, and generating reports on server activities.\n",
      "14. Resource Allocation and Load Balancing: Server management systems help optimize resource\n",
      "allocation and load balancing across servers. They can monitor server workloads, allocate\n",
      "resources based on demand, and distribute incoming network traffic efficiently.\n",

      "                  The problem at hand is to develop an efficient and reliable Proctored Exam Tool that automates the proctoring process and enables institutions, organizations, and testing agencies to administer secure and scalable remote examinations. The Proctored Exam Tool should aim to address the following challenges:\n",
      "1. Remote Monitoring: The software should allow proctors to remotely observe the exam-takers via webcam and screen sharing to ensure that no unauthorized assistance is provided during the exam.\n",
      "2. Identity Verification: Implement a robust identity verification mechanism to ensure that the exam-taker is the intended praticipants, preventing impersonation and fraud.\n",
      "3. Cheating Prevention: Incorporate advanced monitoring features, such as real-time AI-based facial recognition, eye tracking, and suspicious behaviour detection, to identify and flag potential instances of cheating.\n",
      "4. Secure Environment: Ensure that the exam environment remains secure by disabling access to unauthorized resources like other applications, websites, or external devices during the examination.\n",
      "5. Data Privacy: The tool should adhere to stringent data privacy and security standards to protect sensitive information of both exam-takers and organisers.\n",
      "6. User-friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both proctors and exam-takers to facilitate easy navigation and seamless exam administration.\n",
      "7. Scalability: The software should be capable of handling a large number of concurrent exam-takers without compromising on performance or security.\n",
      "8. Compatibility: Ensure compatibility with different operating systems, browsers, and devices to accommodate diverse user preferences and accessibility needs.\n",
      "9. Integration: The Proctored Exam Tool should be able to integrate with various application and assessment platforms commonly used in institutions, organizations, and testing agencies.\n",
      "10. Reporting and Analytics: Provide comprehensive exam reports and analytics to assist institutions in evaluating exam performance, identifying trends, and making data-driven decisions.\n",

      "In the educational ecosystem, the needs of such an environment need to be catered according to the category of ailments that exist in the students and provisions need to be made in order to make them feel special, and cared for and set the right mindset while they grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are very few educational institutes in India, that accept specially-abled students in regular streams making them feel one among natural children. The first and foremost need is to comply with the Disability Act provisions in the Indian education ecosystem and have the right provisions such as physical infrastructure, digital interaction pathways and the right tooling to make this happen in a much larger portion of the Indian education industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "This problem statement hovers more around the lack of the right system and governance in the Indian Education industry and also has to deal with Disability students' intake, progress and outgo after the education completion. The State Education Report for India 2019: Children with Disabilities by UNESCO states that 27% of disabled children between the age of 5-19 years don't have access to education. It also says that nearly 3/4th of 5 years old specially-abled are left out of the education system, further revealing that this ratio varies gender-wise and girls tend to show in high numbers when it comes to depriving education.\n",
      "As per WHO report, over 1 billion people in the world are specially abled contributing to 15% of the total population and WHODAS 2.0 accessibility standards define means of assessing the disability in an individual, which ponder on a lot of aspects such as, it has been felt that differently-abled persons need special arrangements in the environment for their mobility and independent functioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also a fact that many institutes have architectural barriers that disabled persons find difficult for their day-to-day functioning. The colleges are expected to address accessibility-related issues as per the stipulations of the Persons with Disabilities Act 1995 and ensure that all existing structures as well as future construction projects in their campuses are made disabled-friendly. The institutes should create special facilities such as ramps, rails and special toilets, and make other necessary changes to suit the special needs of differently-abled persons. The construction plans should clearly address the accessibility issues pertaining to disability. Guidelines on accessibility are laid out by the office of the Chief Commissioner of Disabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consciously improving Education for specially-abled children will need planned efforts with the help of technology and human power. This makes the problem statement quite challenging and critical to be addressed the special compliance and governance needs. This problem statement needs holistic solutions that may be hybrid in nature. The objective of this problem statement in one way could be the right implementation of the Disability Act and the provisioning of digital infrastructure and applications to address the needs and feedback mechanisms. Facilitate admission of differently-abled persons in various courses, provide guidance and counselling to differently-abled individuals, Create awareness about the needs of differently-abled persons, and other general issues concerning their learning. Assist differently-abled graduates to gain successful employment in the public as well as private sectors, designing special interaction gateways for such children and helping them feel natural while growing is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application/s that can use this information and generate knowledge, spread massive awareness, and support the intake and management of specially-abled children into the educational ecosystem.\n",
      "The objective of this problem statement solution is also to come up with innovative solutions which may use digital and physical mediums together to make sure disabled persons are able to access and operate these applications. The solution may use technologies like Artificial intelligence, machine learning and internet of things and blockchain to ensure specially-abled children are given the right systems to get into the mainstream of education, sustain with growth aspects and be placed well after their education is completed. It is all about following laws and legal procedures to comply with the Disability Act and make sure the system is governed well for specially-abled people's needs in their complete education lifecycle.\n",

      "                  Once the class size passes a certain point, the teachers are bound to 'fail' because the demands on their time cannot be met. In essence, the root of this problem is not the number of children in a classroom but rather the inability for each child to receive adequate attention. Combining modern technology and 1:1 tuition, students could perform far beyond other students who were being taught in more conventional ways. By combining blended learning (where face-to-face teaching is combined with online learning) with real-time data, we can get rapid feedback in classrooms and use that feedback to further enhance the quality of education.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example, consider a classroom of 30 students. Ten students with similar abilities may work closely with the teacher, another ten may work through lectures and online tasks using computer terminals, and the final ten may work together on a group project. In the next lesson, students are rotated so they can learn in different ways throughout the course. This kind of approach enables the teacher to focus more closely on fewer children at once. The teacher can also tailor the learning approach for each student based on how well each one works for the individual. Meanwhile, the software on the computer is advanced enough to tailor the content to each student as well. By collecting real-time feedback on each child's results, the course contents can be adapted per student and make it as if they were receiving a one-on-one tuition. This approach allows each student to have their own learning path that's customized to their needs. By doing this, teachers can easily see which students are falling behind and offer more individualized teaching to those students.\n",
      "\n",
      "If more schools were to adopt a similar approach, where some responsibilities could be handled by tech-aided learning methods, more of the teachers' time could be freed-up to give more attention where it's needed the most, even in larger classroom sizes. Further the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application's that can use this information and generate knowledge, spread massive awareness, and support education delivery effectiveness of students into educational ecosystem and generate insights based on data it collected. The objective of this problem statement solution is also to come up with innovative solution which may use digital and physical medium together to make sure specially abled students who are slow learners are identified, their progress is monitored and right alarms and notifications are generated to assist keeping their education on track with elevated motivation. The solution may use technologies like Artificial intelligence, machine learning and internet of things and blockchain to ensure specially abled children are given right systems and interfaces to learn and grow. This solution's objective is to make sure learning becomes seamless and peaceful with right insights and aids for the children.\n",

      "After all, there are (and will always be) plenty of options open to teachers to introduce more creativity and innovation to their lessons. Some of the options include Learning Management System (LMS), which allows teachers to create their own personalized, interactive courses from content provided by a range of publishers. Students can then access these courses on any device, while the app keeps a record of how they are progressing. If students are struggling. the course can quickly be altered.\n",
      "If students struggle with boredom, game-based learning can be introduced with LMS.\n",
      "Although granting teachers access to tablets and smartboards may help boost their comfort with education technology, many teachers simply have not thought about how they can best utilize technology in their curriculum. Indeed, the way a history teacher utilizes laptops in the classroom may be very different than the way a math teacher utilizes a smartboard. Both likely require plenty of time for trial, error, and experimentation to bring their lesson plans up to date. A major challenge in the adoption of new tools is not providing teachers with the guidance they need to make education technology work for them in their specific classroom.\n",

      "                  Fire Prevention is better than Firefighting. With an increase in Industrialization and globalisation, there has been a spate of fire accidents occurring in the past few years. Every fire incident in industries causes massive losses to the assets of the nation. There are various cases of fire which caused enormous loss of property and human life, like the IOCL Jaipur fire in 2009, NTPC Power Plant Explosion, Unchahar in 2017, and various others. As per the National Crime Records Bureau, over 60 people die every day in India due to fire. In IOCL 2009 fire itself, the industry suffered a loss of thousands of crores. To prevent such incidents and minimize such economic losses, all industries need to have a Fire Pre Plan which should be a part of the Emergency Response and Disaster Management Plan (ERDMP), and the extent of a fire hazard which includes Flammability Area, Toxic Area and Threat zone calculation is instrumental in designing the Fire Pre-Plan for any industry using Areal Location of Hazardous Atmosphere.\n",

The portal must have the capability to record procurement activities, particularly those involving Micro and Small Enterprises (MSE) and purchases made through the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) portal. The solution should enable efficient data entry, storage, retrieval, and analysis of procurement details, payment records, and vendor information. It should also ensure data security and compliance with relevant regulations. By addressing this challenge, the aim is to enhance transparency, streamline procurement operations, promote MSE participation, and facilitate effective financial management for NEEPCO.\n",

      "                  Electricity is the critical need for progress of the livelihood.ln many Indian cities, the maintenance of street lights has become a challenging and inefficient process due to the lack of a centralized monitoring system. ldentifying faults, such as non-\n",
      "functioning lights, current leakage and cable breakage, relies on citizen grievances, leading to delays, increased costs, and safety concerns. Linemen spend valuable time manually searching for faults, diagnosing issues, and fixing them, which can take several days to complete. The absence of precise fault location information further complicates the process. To overcome these obstacles, we seek an innovative solution that provides realtime fault detection, accurate identification of fault types, and precise location tracking of faulty street lights. This solution aims to empower linemen with efficient fault management capabilities, reducing their workload and ensuring timely maintenance. Moreover, it should enable the local authorities to proactively address faults, enhance service quality, and optimize street light maintenance processes in their respective cities..The prime aim of this problem statement is to develop a \"Automated Defect Detection and Prevention Assistance with Effective Governance for Cities in India\"\"\"\n",

      "                  The problem at hand revolves around the management of construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste in urban areas. With rapid urbanization and infrastructure development, the volume of C&amp;D waste generated has reached alarming levels. The current practices for C&amp;D waste disposal often lead to environmental degradation, resource depletion, and public health hazards. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive and sustainable approach to C&amp;D waste management that focuses on reducing waste generation, promoting recycling and reuse, and ensuring proper disposal methods. This will contribute to sustainable urban development by minimizing environmental impact, conserving resources, and creating a healthier living environment for communities. The problem solution should be addressed at the Hardware level and also forefronted using an intelligent monitoring system\n",

      "                  Water resources across the globe are slowly on the depletion and its forecasted that the ZERO water day will not be far away if water resources ate not protected well. one the the crucial area that stilp lies in the human hands is to save the watet leakages and pay a strong water distrulibution network that improves effeicient use of water.The challenge is to conduct thorough inspections of water supply distribution lines, ranging from 100 to 200mm in diameter, in order to detect leakages, pilferage, damage, and other issues. The solution requires access to a cloud_based dashboard for data analytics, visualization, and report generation. The solution enhance service delivery, improve repair work efficiency, reduce water leakage, and streamline pipeline condition assessment. The solution should enable immediate action on contamination complaints, early detection of leaks, reduction in labor_intensive breakdown management, and facilitate GIS mapping of the pipelines. Overcoming deployment constraints involving live inspections, image analytics, and laser projections will ensure accurate and efficient assessment of the water supply distribution lines.\n",

      "                  ln lndia, the number of vehicles is constanfly on the rise, while the availability of parking space in cities has not kept pace with the increasing vehicle numbers, primarily due to the rapid groMh in population. Consequenfly, issues such as traffic congestion, narrowed streets due to on-street parking, a mismatch between parking supply and demand, and illegal parking have become all too familiar in lndian cities. Parking space has become a scarce commodity, and instead of simply increasing the number of available parking spaces, it is crucial to employ effective technology-based solutions to optimize their utilization. Smart parking solutions, utilizing sensors and software, can provade realtime information on available parking spaces to both city officials and drivers. Furthermore, leveraging emerging technologies can help optimize parking prices. A low parking price may encourage more vehicles on the road, leading to increased air and noise pollution, whereas too high prices may generate less revenue and less efectuve resource usage.Apart from the loss of revenue for operators, there is economic downside to the business in vicinity, effect on government taxes, employment.At the same parking space area and costs also have a corelation to balance optimum usage and revenue. Therefore, setting the right price for parking based on demand and optimizing occupancy is the best approach. The primary objective of the solution should be to equip city administrators with an effective parking management tool that can predict, manage, and finance parking in cities. An app should be developed to allow citizens to conveniently reserve pce king spots and make payments based on dynamic pricing This not only saves citizens' time spent searching the parking but also reduces environmental degradation resulting from congestion caused by parking and provides a sustainable source of revenue for the city\n",

      "                  A robust grievance redressal mechanism is a crucial component of any administration. An efficient and effective procedure for addresstng grievances demonstrates an administration's accountability responsiveness, and user-friendliness. However, the ease of lodging a complaint or grievance by citizens is often lacking in many lndian cities. Given the large migratory population in tndian cities, consisting of individuals who may not be familiar with English, Hindi, or the local regional language, citizens face challenges in lodging their grievances. Moreover, the process of lodging a gflevance is not always straightforward. Some department websites are inaccessible, and locating the correct website for a specific department can be difficult. lntroducing an Al-based chatbot that allows citizens to dictate their grievances in their local language and lodge them, would greatly assist citizens. This tool should be able to understand and process complaints effectively, assign them to the relevant department, and provide citizens with a unique complaint number. Real-time updates on the status of the complaint should be sent to citizens, enabling one-on-one conversations throughout the grievance lifecycle. The primary objective of this solution should be to provide citizens with an easy-to_use chatbot that facilitates efficient lodging and tracking of grievances. This would not only save citizens' time in searching for the appropriate department or category but also enabl; the administration to receive targeted grievances and enhance overall service delivery.\n",

For example, a Country, City and State table containing the possible universe of names. It should take into account spelling errors in the names and multiple ways of spelling and mentioning the same entity in the query and map it to a canonical name.  \n",

      "                  We have TMC images of nearly 80% area of the moon at 5m resolution while OHRC data at 25cm resolution have very limited coverage. Due to limited coverage  of OHRC, there are constraints to land at any place on the moon's surface. Hence,  a problem has been defined to create hazard map using super resolution  techniques from TMC 5m images considering the hazard definitions (like Slope 10 degree, Crater / Boulder depth/height – 1m, Crater distribution, shadow etc.)  for safely navigating a Lander. This challenge includes the showcasing of lander  navigation techniques for safe landing considering reference as TMC 5m  datasets in near real time.\n",

      "                  Email communication is a fundamental part of modern business and personal interactions. However, conventional encryption mechanisms are susceptible to various threats, including eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and data breaches in the post quantum era. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers an unprecedented level of security by distributing secure keys to two users over a quantum channel and these keys can be used for encryption to achieve unconditional/enhanced security. \n",
      "The objective is to develop an email client application like Microsoft Outlook (can be named as QuMail) which integrates Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) service with existing email protocols to enhance the security of email communication while maintaining compatibility with widely used email servers (Gmail, yahoo mail etc). \n",
      "This application interfaces with KM (Key Manager) for getting the quantum keys using APIs (illustrated below), with Email servers through standard protocols to utilize email service facility and with users through GUI for capturing various user inputs.  \n",
      "Use case Scenario-  \n",
      "Users (having quantum keys access through the KM) need to exchange email with attachment over untrusted networks (i.e. internet) and existing email service providers (Gmail, Yahoo mail etc). It is assumed that local key managers at both ends have already generated symmetrical quantum keys at their ends. The participants may start with a key bank of 100 keys, each of size 1Kb at KMs.  \n",

      "a. Level 1- No Quantum security  \n",
      "b. Level 2- Quantum-aided AES- use Quantum keys as seed for AES \n",
      "c. Level 3- Quantum Secure - use One Time Pad \n",
      "d. Any other encryption may be given as option \n",
      "Challenges- \n",

      "                  DNS Filtering service helps block malicious domains and prevent malware from  communicating with Command-and-control servers. It also aids in blocking  phishing attacks, playing a crucial role in enhancing security and ensuring  appropriate content access. The solution should provide a secure DNS resolver  that blocks resolution of malicious domain names. It should be capable of  detecting and filtering malicious domains using blacklists, threat intelligence  feeds with support for STIX/TAXII protocol, and leveraging AL/ML for identifying  malicious domains generated using domain generation algorithms or any other  techniques employed by botnets. The solution should also be able to detect  attempts at DNS tunnelling employed by malwares. It should allow the  resolution of non-malicious domain names while blocking the resolution of  malicious domains. Furthermore, the solution should support DNS over UDP,  DNS over DTLS and DNS over HTTPS for DNS resolution. It should be scalable to  handle a large volume of DNS queries and maintain an average DNS lookup time  within 100 milliseconds. Additionally, the solution should support DNS caching  for faster resolution. The solution should be capable of conducting both active  analysis of DNS queries to filter malicious domains and passive analysis of DNS  data provided in PCAP format or Zeek TSV format for the detection of malicious  domains. It should also provide a web interface for monitoring statistics on  malicious domains identified in DNS queries, as well as source IP addresses that  generated those queries.\n",
